# employeePayrollTracker
Allows user to add employees and salaries.  Stores data internally and logs results
## Description
This exercise allows the user to add employees with the "Add Employee" button.  User is prompted to add first name, last name, and a salary.  User is then prompted to add another user if desired.  They can add as many users as they would like, and this information will be stored in an unbounded array.  This feature combines the principles of while loops, window.prompt methods, window.alert methods, and more.

Be sure to inspect the page to see more in the console!

In addition to building a table on the page, this page will log the data in the console. 

Finally, you will see in the console a log of the number of employees you've entered, the average salary of all your employees, and a log of 1 employee chosen at random.
